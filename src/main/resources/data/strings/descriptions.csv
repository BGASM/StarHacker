sh_comm_relay,CUSTOM,"A Domain-era technology used primarily on the frontier, this is a hyperwave communications array which transmits and receives data between star systems at faster-than-light speeds. The rapidly pulsing hyperwaves suitable for FTL data transmission have been shown to damage DNA so these relays are always stationed away from habitats.",,,
sh_comm_relay_makeshift,CUSTOM,"An imitation of the Domain-era counterpart, constructed using what passes for the state of the art in the Sector. Nonetheless, a makeshift comm relay is capable of facilitating faster-than-light comms between star systems, even if the transmission speeds are less than ideal and the occasional phantom comm streams picked up give nightmares to even the most seasoned operators.",,,
sh_nav_buoy,CUSTOM,"A Domain-era technology, a nav buoy monitors the in-system hyperfield and is capable of transmitting its findings to friendly fleets in-system. The data readings are pristine and of great use in configuring drive fields.",,,
sh_nav_buoy_makeshift,CUSTOM,"Built using the best technology available in the Sector, a nav buoy monitors the in-system hyperfield and is capable of transmitting its findings to friendly fleets in-system. The data is often somewhat unreliable but still useful in making on-the-fly drive field adjustments.",,,
sh_sensor_array,CUSTOM,"A Domain-era technology, this is a super-high-resolution passive monitoring array with a transmitter capable of real-time, faster-than-light data transmission within the star system. The data is useful to supplement the regular sensor readings made by fleets.",,,
sh_sensor_array_makeshift,CUSTOM,"Built using the best technology available in the Sector, a makeshft sensor array is nonetheless capable of passively monitoring the entire star system and has a transmitter capable of real-time, faster-than-light data transmission to friendly fleets within. The data is useful to supplement the regular sensor readings made by fleets.",,,
