# Star Hacker

<p>This is my attempt at bringing some table-top RPG hacking elements to Star Sector. While currently
in development - any feedback from the playerbase on features they would like/hate to see would be 
welcome.</p>
<p>My goal is to expand the utility of hacking in Star Sector in way that is in-theme, engaging, and balanced.</p>
<p>Overall, this mod aims to bring in a compelling side-hustle for players to: earn some creds, gain leverage in a fight, 
sabotage foes, and snoop up intel. At the same time, all of these aspects should carry risk and require planning and
strategy.</p>

Inspiration for this comes from books, television, and MUDs I have enjoyed, including:
- Neuromancer, William Gibson  
- Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson 
- Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe
- Bladerunner, Ridley Scott
- The Matrix, The Wachowskis
- Sindome, Johnny



## Development Roadmap
- [ ] Expand current Objective hacks to test limitations of the vanilla system.
   <details><summary>More!</summary>
    
      1. Increase the risk vs. reward aspect of objective hacking:
         Hacked comm sensors allow for real time market tracking for a system, sensors let you see what transponders 
         are active in a system, etc.
      2. Test the 'funness' of elements planned on being incorporated further in development:
         If a hack takes longer time to allow for the chance of detection is that still fun? 
      3. Test the balance of planned features:
         How severe should failure be that keeps players engaged and the mod installed? 
         What about success - how much reward is too much? 
         What breaks the game or makes other gameplay loops stale?

- [ ] Implement new hacking interactions for other entities: ships, markets, gates, etc.
   <details><summary>More!</summary>
  
      Examples:
      1. Hacking an NPC ship to learn its intended destination, hijack market-access data,
      sniff any intel it has (or randomly generate some - I have no idea if the NPCs have their own intel).
      
      2. Hack a market to add yourself to their logs as an incorporated entity (made this term up) to reduce
      tariffs on the white-market, or falsify data to create a panic-shortage that you could take advantage of.
      
      My Guidelines:
      This game is about flying space ships, not clicking through dialog menus. So my focus
      would be on keeping you in a menu for as short as possible, while still providing flexible options for
      different playstyles and builds.
      
      Hacking should augment gameplay, but not steal spotlight. So figuring out ways to incorporate hacking
      against these entities while now overpowering the player too much.

- [ ] Implement a soft skill tree
   <details><summary>More!</summary>
  
      In true table-top fashion, the player should be able to pick some stats and skills at char gen that
      will influence difficulty and outcome of hacking.
      
      I don't think I would want to try and add an additional fork to the existing skill tree. That seems
      too in-focus. My idea now would be choices made at chargen via dialog that are saved to the player memory.
   </details>
- [ ] Implement a hacking 'resource' akin to supplies/fuel
   <details><summary>More!</summary>
     
      It is no fun if the player has infinite resources.
      
      The resource should be appropriately restricted - so something that can be found only on black markets
      or from factions who specialize in being nerds.
      
      It should be in-theme.
      
      Its limitation or excess should only affect the mod-space. It should not change vanilla gameplay 
      (except for potentially being illegal cargo). But, if the player has 0 of this resource, it should
      only restrict their ability to do things that the mod uses the currency for. Same if the player is
      rich in this, it shouldn't give them any other advantage outside of its use in the mod.
  </details>
  
- [ ] Implement inventory items or hullmods that equate to a 'deck' as well as hacks.
   <details><summary>More!</summary>
  
      1. Straight up Console Cowboy, Neuromancer style baby.
      2. Decks should have their own stats: processing power, storage, firewall etc.
      3. Some ideas right now are that various 'hacks' would be items bought at theme-appropriate markets that
   would be used when attempting a certain hack. Another idea is that your deck has a flavored hack-suite and
   the various hacks are tied to it.
